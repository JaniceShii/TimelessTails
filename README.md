# TimelessTails
Timeless Tails is a Java-based virtual pet simulator game where players care for one of three Pokémon-inspired companions. Each pet has distinct traits, needs, and minigame challenges, and requires regular care to stay happy.

**🕹️ Gameplay Overview**
Choose from Furfrou, Tyrunt, or Magearna to start your adventure. Monitor pet vitals (health, happiness, sleep, fullness) and interact through actions like Feed, Play, Go to Bed, and Take to Vet. Letting vitals drop to zero causes your pet’s health to deteriorate, eventually leading to death. Inventory items (gifts, food) can be collected during walks and used to boost stats. Save and load up to three game files to continue progress across sessions.

**🛠️ Additional Features**
- Built-in parental controls to manage playtime and revive pets
- Real-time stat decay using Java threading
- Interactive UI built with Java Swing
