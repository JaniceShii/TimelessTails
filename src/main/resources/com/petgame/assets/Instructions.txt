Timeless Tails Instructions

Objective: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The objective of our specific game is to create an experience for users to learn about simple life skills and routine management. 
Through an interactive and engaging pet simulator with mouse based interaction, users must take care of a pet of their choice and maintain the pet’s health stats. 
There will be various activities that contribute to either increasing or decreasing the stats, such as...
    1. Health: Represents how healthy the pet currently is. A zero value is dead, a maximum value is perfectly healthy. If health reaches zero, the pet dies, and the game ends. If below 25%, a warning appears. Can be raised by taking the pet to the pokemon center
    2. Sleep:Represents how tired the pet is. A low value is very sleepy, and a high value is perfectly awake. Declines over time at a set rate (rate differs per pet). When at zero, the pet forcibly falls asleep, applies a health penalty, and cannot be interacted with until it recovers. If below 25%, a warning appears. Can be increased by clicking the sleep button. 
    3. Fullness: Represents how hungry the pet is. A low value is very hungry, and a high value is perfectly full. This value declines overtime at a set rate. If below 25%, a warning appears. Pets can eat different foods to increase this stat.
    4. Happiness: Represents how happy the pet is with the player. A low value is angry, and a high value is very happy. Declines naturally over time at a steady rate. If a player reaches 0% in this statistic, they become really angry and don’t listen to any commands unless they are related to increasing their happiness. If below 25%, a warning appears.Can be increased by playing the obstacle dodge mini game, sleeping, and eating.
